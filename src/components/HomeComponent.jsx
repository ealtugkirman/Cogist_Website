            The Cognizer is a publishing platform initiated by CogIST, a
            cognitive science community from Turkey. <br />
            On this platform, articles and essays on different topics from
            different fields of cognitive science are published in a way that
            would bridge the gap between public audience and experts. To
            accomplish this, we will ensure that the publications are
            argumentatively sophisticated, although not technically complex,
            thus preventing the loss of information and insight while
            popularizing academic content. In this way, not only we encourage
            science communication in the field of cognitive science but also
            reach a diverse audience from all around the world, especially from
            the underrepresented regions.
